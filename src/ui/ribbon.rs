//! `RibbonAction` — the shared action enum for the merged file/format bar.
//!
//! The ribbon UI itself is gone: it and the format toolbar were two
//! horizontal icon strips ~60px apart for historical reasons, not by
//! design (formatting buttons were split out into `format_toolbar.rs` at
//! some point). Both are now rendered together by
//! `format_toolbar::FormatToolbar::show`. This module survives only to hold
//! the `RibbonAction` enum both the file/tool buttons and the markdown
//! formatting buttons emit, and which `app/mod.rs` still dispatches on.
