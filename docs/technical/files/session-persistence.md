# Session Persistence & Crash Recovery

## Overview

Ferrite implements crash-safe session persistence that saves and restores the full editor session state (open tabs, active tab, scroll positions, cursor positions, and unsaved content) across restarts and after crashes.

## Architecture

### Session State Model

The session persistence system consists of three main components:

1. **SessionState** - Top-level session state containing:
   - Schema version (for migration support)
   - Timestamp of last save
   - Clean shutdown flag
   - List of open tabs (SessionTabState)
   - Active tab index
   - Application mode (single file or workspace)

2. **SessionTabState** - Per-tab state including:
   - Tab ID
   - File path (if saved)
   - Display title
   - View mode (Raw/Rendered)
   - Cursor position (character index and line/column)
   - Selection range
   - Scroll offset
   - Has unsaved content flag
   - File modification time (for conflict detection)
   - Original content hash

3. **RecoveryContent** - Stored separately for tabs with unsaved changes:
   - Tab ID
   - Full document content
   - Save timestamp
   - **`path`** (added in task 106) — file path the recovery is anchored to (`None` for untitled tabs)
   - **`original_content_hash`** (task 106) — hash of the on-disk content the tab was loaded from when the recovery was written
   - **`schema_version`** (task 106) — defaults to `1` for legacy files via serde defaults; future schema bumps are rejected at the loader boundary

4. **AutoSaveMetadata** - JSON header for `<file>.autosave` temp files:
   - Tab ID, original path, save timestamp, content hash
   - **`disk_content_hash`** (task 106) — hash of the on-disk content the tab was loaded from at the moment this autosave was written; defaults to `None` for legacy files via serde defaults

5. **RecoveryConflict** (task 106.5) - Lives on `AppState.recovery_conflicts` keyed by `tab_id` while the central panel banner is visible:
   - `recovered_content` — buffer applied during restore
   - `on_disk_content` — current disk content captured at restore time

### File Locations

All session files are stored in the user's config directory:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\ferrite\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/ferrite/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/ferrite/`

Files:
- `session.json` - Clean session state (saved on normal shutdown)
- `session.recovery.json` - Crash recovery state (saved periodically)
- `session.lock` - Lock file (indicates app is running)
- `recovery/` - Directory containing per-tab recovery content files

### Persistence Flow

#### On Startup
1. Create lock file to detect future crashes
2. Check for crash recovery file and lock file presence
3. If crash detected (lock file existed from previous session):
   - Load crash recovery state
   - If unsaved changes exist, show recovery dialog
   - User can choose to restore or start fresh
4. If clean shutdown (no lock file):
   - Silently restore session from session.json

#### While Running
- Session save throttle (5 second debounce)
- On content changes, mark session as dirty
- Periodically save crash recovery snapshot
- Save recovery content for tabs with unsaved changes

#### On Clean Shutdown
1. Capture session state
2. Mark as clean shutdown
3. Save to session.json
4. Clear crash recovery data
5. Remove lock file

## Recovery UI

When crash recovery is detected with unsaved changes, a modal dialog appears offering:

- **Restore Session**: Restores all tabs from the previous session, including recovered unsaved content
- **Start Fresh**: Discards the recovery data and starts with an empty editor

If Ferrite was launched with file paths (e.g. double-click while the app was closed), those paths are **deferred** until the user answers the dialog, then opened afterward (existing tabs with the same path are focused, not duplicated).

### Recovery vs. Disk Conflict Banner (task 106.5)

When an identity-validated recovery file is applied but its buffer differs from
the current disk content, the central panel renders a non-blocking banner above
the editor for the active tab. Editing is allowed while the banner is visible —
only the two action buttons clear it:

- **Keep Recovered** (`AppState::keep_recovered_buffer`) — drops the conflict
  entry; the buffer stays modified so the user can save manually.
- **Reload from Disk** (`AppState::apply_reload_from_disk_for_conflict`) —
  replaces the tab buffer with the on-disk content captured at restore time
  and marks the tab saved.

Closing the tab also clears any pending conflict so the banner cannot resurrect
on a future tab whose runtime id collides with the cleared one.

## Identity-Gated Recovery (task 106)

Recovery files in `recovery/<tab_id>.json` and autosave files under `autosave/`
persist across launches, but the per-session `tab_id` namespace is reset to 0
on every launch and re-issued monotonically. Without identity checks, a
leftover recovery file from a previous session could silently apply to an
unrelated tab in the current session that happened to be assigned the same id
— a data-loss hazard ("cross-tab bleed"; the original repro was an untitled
buffer named `asdasd` for `tab_id=10` overwriting
`task_50_table_inline_formatting.md` on save).

`AppState::try_apply_recovery` (`src/state.rs`) gates application of recovery
content in three layers, in order:

1. **Legacy bypass.** Pre-task-106 files have neither `path` nor
   `original_content_hash` set. They fall back to historical "tab id only"
   matching so users upgrading from older Ferrite versions don't lose
   recovered text. No conflict banner can be raised in this branch.
2. **Path equality.** `recovered.path` must equal `session_tab.path` (covers
   untitled tabs via `None == None`). A mismatch indicates a reused tab id and
   is rejected with the `session_recovery_identity_mismatch` diag event.
3. **Disk hash.** When the tab is path-backed and the file exists on disk,
   the current disk content is hashed (same algorithm as
   `crate::config::hash_content`) and compared against
   `recovered.original_content_hash`. A mismatch means the file was edited
   externally between sessions; the recovery is rejected and the caller falls
   through to a fresh disk load. Encoding-failure on `read_to_string` is
   tolerated (path identity is trusted).

When all three layers pass and the recovered buffer differs from current disk
content, `try_apply_recovery` returns
`ResolvedContent::RecoveredWithDiskDivergence { content, on_disk_content }`
and `restore_from_session_result` populates `AppState.recovery_conflicts` so
the banner described above is rendered.

### Disk-hash anchoring across recovery cycles

**Invariant:** after `restore_from_session_result` applies a divergent
recovery, the new `Tab` must keep `original_content` (and therefore
`disk_content_hash()`) anchored to the **actual on-disk text**, not to the
recovered buffer.

If the anchor is set to the recovered buffer instead, the bug manifests on
the *second* crash/restore cycle:

1. Edit → kill → Restore. `Tab::with_file(path, recovered)` was used, so
   `original_content == content`, `is_modified() == false`, and
   `disk_content_hash() == hash(recovered)`.
2. New edits happen → `is_modified()` flips to `true` → the next crash
   snapshot writes `recovery/<id>.json` with
   `original_content_hash = hash(recovered)`.
3. Kill → restart. Disk hash check in `try_apply_recovery` compares
   `hash(disk) != hash(recovered)` and rejects the recovery file. The tab
   silently falls back to disk content — every edit since the previous
   recovery is gone.

`restore_from_session_result` handles this by using `on_disk_content` for
the constructor call when the resolver returned
`ResolvedContent::RecoveredWithDiskDivergence`, then calling `set_content`
to swap in the recovered buffer (which bumps `content_version`, records one
undo step, and leaves `original_content` pointing at disk). Regression
tests: `test_restore_with_divergence_anchors_original_to_disk` and
`test_restore_then_edit_keeps_disk_hash_anchor` in `state.rs`.

The autosave path enforces equivalent identity in
`config::session::check_auto_save_identity`:
`metadata.original_path != tab_path` is rejected outright; when
`metadata.disk_content_hash` is `Some(want)` the disk is re-hashed and a
mismatch is rejected. Both sides emit the same
`session_recovery_identity_mismatch` diag key (with `source=autosave` in the
message).

### Pruning Stale Files

`AppState::prune_stale_recovery_files` runs once after session restore and
deletes:

- `recovery/<tab_id>.json` whose id is not in the live tab set
  (`config::prune_recovery_dir`)
- `autosave/untitled_<tab_id>.md.autosave` whose id is not in the live tab
  set (`config::prune_auto_save_dir`)

Path-backed autosaves (`<stem>_<pathhash>.md.autosave`) are not pruned by id
because they are keyed by file path; identity for those is enforced at
recovery time by `check_auto_save_identity`.

## Conflict Detection

The system tracks file modification time to detect conflicts:

- **NoConflict**: File hasn't changed since last read
- **ModifiedOnDisk**: File was modified externally
- **FileDeleted**: File no longer exists
- **NoFile**: Tab has no associated file

This is independent of the identity-gated recovery banner above: mtime-based
conflict detection runs at restore time for every tab, while the recovery
banner only appears for tabs whose recovered buffer differs from current disk
after passing the identity gate.

## Implementation Files

- `src/config/session.rs` - Session state model, persistence functions, and identity helpers (`check_auto_save_identity`, `prune_recovery_dir`, `prune_auto_save_dir`)
- `src/config/mod.rs` - Module exports
- `src/state.rs` - `capture_session_state()`, `restore_from_session_result()`, `try_apply_recovery()`, conflict-banner action methods (`keep_recovered_buffer`, `apply_reload_from_disk_for_conflict`)
- `src/app/mod.rs` - Lifecycle integration (startup, periodic saves, shutdown), autosave loop with `disk_content_hash` propagation
- `src/app/central_panel.rs` - `render_recovery_conflict_banner` (task 106.5)

## Workspace Session Persistence

### Workspace Path Handling

The session system stores the workspace root path when in workspace mode:

1. **On Save**: The workspace path is canonicalized before saving to ensure consistent storage across restarts and to resolve any relative paths or symlinks.

2. **On Restore**: The system:
   - Validates the saved path is non-empty
   - Attempts to canonicalize the path for consistency
   - Checks if the path exists on disk
   - Verifies it's actually a directory
   - Falls back to single-file mode if any validation fails

### Debug Logging

Comprehensive debug logging is available for troubleshooting session persistence issues. Enable debug logging with `--log-level debug` to see:

- Session file selection (recovery vs. session.json)
- File modification time comparisons
- Workspace path during save/load operations
- Path canonicalization results
- Validation failures and reasons

### Error Handling for Invalid Paths

The system handles various error conditions gracefully:

- **Empty path**: Session starts in single-file mode
- **Non-existent path**: Warning logged, starts in single-file mode
- **Path not a directory**: Warning logged, starts in single-file mode
- **Workspace open failure**: Warning logged with error details, starts in single-file mode

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Session state serialization/deserialization roundtrip
- Content hashing consistency
- Save throttle timing logic

### Integration Testing
1. Open multiple documents, make edits, close cleanly
2. Reopen - verify all tabs restored with correct positions
3. Open documents, make unsaved changes, force-kill process
4. Reopen - verify recovery dialog appears
5. Test both "Restore" and "Start Fresh" options

### Manual Testing
- Verify session files are created in correct location
- Verify lock file is removed on clean exit
- Verify periodic saves occur while editing
- Test with large files and many tabs

## Future Enhancements

1. **Diff View in Conflict Banner**: Show a side-by-side diff of recovered vs. on-disk inside the banner before the user picks `Keep Recovered` / `Reload from Disk` (task 106.5 just exposes the strings via `RecoveryConflict`).
2. **Rendered Scroll Sync**: Track rendered mode scroll offset separately
3. **Multi-window Support**: Track multiple window states
4. **Session History**: Keep history of previous sessions
5. **Selective Restore**: Allow restoring individual tabs from recovery
