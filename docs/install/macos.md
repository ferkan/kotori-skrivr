# macOS installation and Gatekeeper (v0.3.0)

GitHub release builds of Ferrite for macOS ship as a proper `Ferrite.app` bundle (see [`macos-app-bundle-ci.md`](../technical/platform/macos-app-bundle-ci.md)). **v0.3.0** artifacts from CI are **not** signed with an Apple Developer ID and are **not** notarized. That matches how many open-source projects ship macOS binaries today, but **Gatekeeper**—especially on **macOS 15.x (Sequoia), including 15.6+**—may block or warn on first launch because the system treats the download as untrusted until you explicitly allow it.

GitHub CI builds are not Developer ID signed or notarized. Use the workarounds below, build from source, or install via Homebrew. Tracked: [GitHub issue #130](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/130).

## Why this happens

1. **CI-built `.app` bundles are ad hoc–signed or unsigned** for GitHub Releases—they do not use a paid Developer ID certificate or Apple’s notarization service.
2. **Downloaded archives get the quarantine flag** (`com.apple.quarantine`). Gatekeeper evaluates that flag together with code signatures; without Developer ID + notarization, macOS may refuse to open the app or show “damaged / unidentified developer” style messaging.

The app itself is the same open-source Ferrite you can [build from source](../building.md); the friction is **distribution policy**, not malware.

## Workarounds (pick one)

### 1. Homebrew (often smoothest)

If you install via Homebrew, quarantine handling is typically easier:

```bash
brew tap olaproeis/ferrite
brew install --cask ferrite
```

See also the collapsible **macOS Installation & Gatekeeper** section in the root [`README.md`](../../README.md).

### 2. Finder: Right-click → Open

1. Put `Ferrite.app` in **Applications** (or open it from wherever you copied it).
2. **Control-click** (or right-click) `Ferrite.app` → **Open**.
3. In the dialog, click **Open** again.

**Caveat:** On some **macOS 15.x** configurations this path is **not sufficient** by itself; if the app still refuses to launch, use **System Settings** or the **Terminal** option below.

### 3. System Settings → Privacy & Security

After a blocked launch attempt, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the message about Ferrite, and use **Open Anyway** if Apple presents it.

### 4. Terminal: remove quarantine (reliable for local installs)

This removes the download quarantine extended attribute **recursively** from the app bundle. Adjust the path if you did not install under `/Applications`:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Ferrite.app
```

Then launch Ferrite normally (double-click or Spotlight).

**Path tip:** If the app lives elsewhere (e.g. `~/Applications/Ferrite.app`), substitute that path.

---

## Verify quarantine (optional)

```bash
xattr -l /Applications/Ferrite.app
```

If `com.apple.quarantine` is absent after `xattr -dr`, Gatekeeper should no longer treat the bundle as a freshly quarantined download.
